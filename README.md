Sure, here's how you can explain this code in a README file:

# Python Email Client

This Python script is a simple email client that uses the `smtplib` library to send emails. It also uses the `tkinter` library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for the email client.

## Features

- **Send Emails**: You can use this client to send emails using your Gmail account.
- **GUI**: The client has a simple and easy-to-use GUI that lets you enter the sender's email address, password, recipient's email address, subject, and message.

## How to Use

1. Run the script. A window will open with fields for "From", "Password", "To", "Subject", and "Message".
2. Fill in the "From" field with your Gmail address.
3. Fill in the "Password" field with your Gmail password. For security reasons, the password will be hidden.
4. Fill in the "To" field with the recipient's email address.
5. Fill in the "Subject" field with the subject of your email.
6. Fill in the "Message" field with the body of your email.
7. Click the "Send" button to send the email.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `smtplib` library
- `tkinter` library

Please note that in order to use this script with your Gmail account, you may need to enable "Less secure app access" in your Google account settings. Be aware that this can make your account less secure.
